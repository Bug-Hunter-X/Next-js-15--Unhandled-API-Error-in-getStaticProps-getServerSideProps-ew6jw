In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon bug can occur when using the `async/await` syntax within a component's `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function, particularly when fetching data from an external API.  If the API call fails and throws an error that is not properly handled (e.g., using a `try...catch` block), it can lead to a runtime error that prevents the page from rendering correctly or even crashes the entire Next.js application.  The issue is often obscured because Next.js's error handling mechanism might not provide very specific information about the exact source of the problem within the asynchronous function.
